# [lumaeris.COM](https://lumaeris.com/) ðŸŒŸ

suddenly my new web site

## To-do

- [ ] Migrate to Hugo ~~/Zola~~
- [ ] Placeholder for my future music on `/music`
- [ ] Redirects
- [ ] Blog in `/blog`
- [ ] Create layout for main page and blog
- [ ] Possibly federated comments? Since I already use GtS on .me I might just create a post with the link on my blog and extract comments from GtS, as it was possible with Mastodon
- [ ] Preview version on `preview.lumaeris.com`/`new.lumaeris.com`
- [ ] Migrate to Codeberg? (locked due to lack of redirect support)
- [x] Fill out this list for now
