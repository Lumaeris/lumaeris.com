suddenly my new web site

## To-do

- [x] Migrate to Hugo ~~/Zola~~
- [ ] Placeholder for my future music on `/music`
- [x] Redirects

- [ ] Possibly federated comments? Since I already use GtS on .me I might just create a post with the link on my blog and extract comments from GtS, as it was possible with Mastodon

- [x] Migrate to Codeberg? ~~(locked due to lack of redirect support)~~
