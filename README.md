## To-do

- [ ] Migrate to Zola

- [ ] Create layout for main page and blog
- [ ] Possibly federated comments? ~~Since I already use GtS on .me I might just create a post with the link on my blog and extract comments from GtS, as it was possible with Mastodon~~ 
- [x] Preview version on ~~`preview.lumaeris.com`/`new.lumaeris.com`~~ (`<commit hash>.lumaeris.pages.dev` should be enough)
